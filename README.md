# myUndergraduateStudy
 hi, this is jachin, whoever you are, whatever lead you here!
 
 I am always glad and, also, excited to let the world know me.
 
 I am not that kind of ancestral CS learner, seeing that I changed my major and interest from civil enginering, which had give me a picturesque future full of architectural social network and career life, to computer science and technoilogy.
 
 I know myself very clear with my life passion and future plan, being confident to introduce myself to this joggle-like world, and also dare to say I am mostly best one from the peer in my undergraduate peroid.
